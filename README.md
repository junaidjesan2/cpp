# Phitron Semester 02: C++ Coursework

This repository contains all the C++ code written during the second semester of the Phitron programming course. It covers a wide range of topics, from fundamental concepts to solutions for mid-term and final exams.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

### `/basic`
Contains introductory C++ programs covering basic syntax, input/output, and typecasting.

### `/week-01`
Code and exercises from the first week of the course.
- **/basic**: Focuses on dynamic arrays and handling End-of-File (EOF).
- **/class-and-object**: Introduces classes, objects, constructors, dynamic objects, and returning objects from functions.
- **/practice problems**: A set of problems to practice the concepts learned in week 1.

### `/week-02`
Code and exercises from the second week of the course.
- **/array of object**: Demonstrates how to use arrays of objects, including sorting and finding maximum values.
- **/class_and_string**: Covers string manipulation within classes, sorting, and other string-related functionalities.
- **/context 1072**: Solutions for problems from a programming contest (Contest 1072).
- **/extra problems**: Additional practice problems for week 2 topics.
- **/string**: Basic string operations and capacity management.

### `/mid-exam`
Contains solutions for the mid-term examination problems from HackerRank.

### `/final-exam`
Contains solutions for the final examination problems from HackerRank.

## How to Compile and Run

Each C++ source file (`.cpp`) can be compiled and run individually.

### Compilation
To compile a file, use a C++ compiler like g++.
```bash
g++ your_file_name.cpp -o your_output_name.exe
```

### Execution
To run the compiled program:
```bash
./your_output_name.exe
```

**Note**: Many programs are designed to read input from an `input.txt` file and write their output to an `output.txt` file located in the same directory.
